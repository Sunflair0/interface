			<h3>Learn by doing</h3>
			Interface online courses are different than most
			others - at Interface, you
			learn by doing. You'll still get all the details
			about the web technologies
			of HTML &amp; CSS, but you'll learn them as you build
			a real web site.

			<h3>We got you</h3>
			Students of Interface online courses also receive
			support over Skype to answer
			any questions you may have if you get stuck.
			Email support is also
			available anytime - or to the camera shy!

				<h3>Our story</h3>
				<a href="https://interfaceschool.com">Interface Web School</a>
				is located in Omaha, Nebraska, and has been teaching
				web technology courses live and in-person since 2014. As a startup, we
				were free to develop our personal style of instruction that emphasizes
				the practical topics and experiences to help foster a deeper understanding
				of tech that goes beyond just the syntax.
				<p>
					In 2017 Interface was acquired by the AIM Institute. AIM's mission is to grow, connect and inspire
					the tech talent community through educational and career development initiatives.
					Our focus is to get people excited about technology, and inspire them to pursue a tech career -
					which leads to a better work force and ultimately allows communities to thrive.

				<h3>Our Staff</h3>
				Interface instructors are developers themselves with in-depth experience in the
				technologies they teach. Our senior instructor and curriculum author Kent Smotherman
				has been a professional developer in over a dozen different computer languages througout
				a career spanning nearly 40 years. And most importantly, everyone at Interface has
				an infectious passion for tech and teaching it.
				<p>
					Our career placement specialists assist local students with brushing up their resumes
					and connecting with area employers. Just because class is over doesn't mean you're done!

					As we like to say, if you don't give up on learning, we won't give up on teaching!
